# Art Engine

The HashLips Lab's Art Engine 2 is currently in its alpha phase and is actively
being developed by [Daniel](https://github.com/HashLips) and
[Marco](https://github.com/Liarco).

As with any software in its early stages, there may be bugs present that have
not yet been discovered or resolved. The development team is working diligently
to iron out any issues and bring the engine to a stable and functional state.
